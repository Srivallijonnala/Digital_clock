# Digital_clock
The digital clock displays the current time dynamically using JavaScript. It fetches hours, minutes, and seconds, formats them for readability, and updates every second. Styled with CSS for alignment and visibility, it appears centered. Optionally, a date is included, and the background can feature videos or gradients for enhanced visuals.
